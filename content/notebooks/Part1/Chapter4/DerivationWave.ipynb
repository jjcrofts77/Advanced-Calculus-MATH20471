        "Our derivation will depend upon a number of modelling assumptions. The string of length $L$ will be of uniform mass density and fixed rigidly at both ends as in Figure \\ref{fig:string}(a). The vertical displacement ($y(x, t)$) will be small compared to $L$. We will also neglect stretching and bending of the string; meaning energy losses associated with dampening in the distortion of the string are neglected. Other external forces such as gravity will also be ignored.\n",

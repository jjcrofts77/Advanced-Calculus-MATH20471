# Chapter 1 Introduction

Partial differential equations are an important topic in pure and applied mathematics. This module introduces partial differential equations and their solution. It also considers the extension of calculus to functions of a complex variable. The aim of the module is to broaden and extend your knowledge, understanding and skills in advanced higher calculus, to topics including Fourier series, partial differential equations and complex analysis.

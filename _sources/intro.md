# Course Overview

This Jupyterbook provides the course notes for the second year module Advanced Calculus (MATH20471).

## Part I - PDEs and Fourier Series

The first part of this course of lectures introduces Fourier series, focussing on their practical applications rather than proofs of convergence. We will then discuss how the wave equation, heat equation and Laplace's equation arise in physical models. In each case we will explore basic techniques for solving the equations in several dependent variables.

### Chapter 1 Introduction
   - Initial and boundary value problems (IBVP)
   - ODE revision
   - Introduction to partial differential equations (PDEs)  
   - The equations we shall study

### Chapter 2 Fourier Series
   - Periodic, even and odd functions
   - Fourier series for functions of period $2\pi$
   - Convergence of Fourier series
   - Functions of any period

### Chapter 3 The heat equation
   - Derivation in one space dimension
   - Heat conduction in a finite rod
   - Initial and boundary value problem
   - Uniquness (optional)
   - Non-zero steady state (optional)

### Chapter 4 The wave equation
   - Derivation in 1 space dimension
   - Normal modes of vibration for a finite string
   - Initial and boundary value problems for finite strings
   - Uniqueness of an IBVP for a finite string (optional)
   - The general solution of the wave equation
   - Waves on infinite strings: D'Alembert's formula

### Chapter 5 Laplace's equation in the plane
   - BVP in cartesian coordinates
   - BVP in polar coordinates (optional)
   - Uniqueness (optional)

## Part II Complex Analysis

The second part of this course of lectures considers the extension of calculus to functions of a complex variable. It develops theory with important applications such as evaluation of contour integrals using residue calculus as well as real-valued integrals that arise in engineering applications.

### Chapter 1 Prerequisites
   - Revision of complex numbers
   - Complex valued functions

### Chapter 2 Differentiation
   - Consequences/uses of the Cauchy-Riemann equations

### Chapter 3 Singularities
   - Poles
   - Removable singularities
   - Essenital singularities
   - Singularities at infinity (optional)

### Chapter 4 Integration
   - Preliminary definitions
   - The fundamental theorem of contour integration
   - Cauchy's integral theorems
   - The annulus (or deformation) theorem 

### Chapter 5 Taylor and Laurent series 
   - Taylor series for complex valued functions
   - Laurent series


### Chapter 6 Residues in complex variable analysis
   - Cauchy's residue theorem
   - Calculating residues
   - Evaluation of real integrals

# Chapter 1 Introduction

These lecture notes are designed to accompany the second half of the second year course `Advanced Calculus'. The second part of this course of lectures considers the extension of calculus to functions of a complex variable. It develops theory with important applications such as evaluation of contour integrals using residue calculus as well as real-valued integrals that arise in engineering applications.

# 5.1 BVP in catesian coordinates

Consider the following BVP: find the solution of Laplace's equation (\ref{eqn:LaplaceCh5}) which is defined on the rectangle 
$\{(x,y): 0\leq x\leq a, 0\leq y\leq b\}$ (see figure ???) and satisfies the boundary conditions

$$
 T(0,y)=T(a,y)=0, \quad 0<y<b,
$$

and

$$
 T(x,0)=0 \text{ and } T(x,b)=f(x), 0<x<a.
$$

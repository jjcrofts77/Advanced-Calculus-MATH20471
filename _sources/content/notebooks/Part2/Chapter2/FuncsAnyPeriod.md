# 2.4 Functions of any period

Consider a function $f$ of period $2L (L>0)$. We want a series in $\cos(n\pi x/L)$ and $\sin(n\pi x/L)$. To do 
this we make the transformation $X=\pi x/L$. Formally, we define $g(X) = f(x) = f(LX/\pi)$ so that

$$
g(X+2\pi) = f\left(\frac{L(X+2\pi)}{\pi}\right) = f\left(\frac{LX}{\pi}+2L\right) = f\left(\frac{LX}{\pi}\right) = g(X),
$$

and $g(X)$ is $2\pi$ periodic. Hence the previous theory holds for $g$, *i.e.* if we can write

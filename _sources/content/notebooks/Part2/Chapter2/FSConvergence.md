# 2.3 Convergence of Fourier series

For the previous example it does appear that except at points of discontinuity the partial sums do converge to $f(x)$. 
At points of discontinuity they converge to zero. A similar result is true for most functions that appear in applications. 
To present this result we first need to discuss one-sided limits.

    "In general the solution of a partial differential equation is frequently difficult \n",
    "to find; however, the method of *separation of variables*, which we shall study in \n",
    "the chapters to come, provides a useful technique for determining solutions to a large \n",
    "class of linear partial differential equations. There are fundamentally three types of \n",
    "partial differential equations -- those that govern diffusion processes, those that \n",
    "govern wave propagation, and those that model equilibrium processes. These types are\n",
    "called *parabolic*, *hyperbolic* and *elliptic*, respectively. In this \n",
    "course we we study prototypical examples of each of the three classes of linear \n",
